                      Orientation week was buzzing with so many great people with amazing
                      potential to become the best web developers they can be. It was
                      intimidating but really exciting!

                    <p>
                      When I was first introduced to coding, I was confused beyond
                      believe. I hadn't known how to read anything or what to do, or to
                      even push! But as I am progressing, it is becoming more familiar.

                    <h2>Introduction to HTML & CSS:</h2>
                    <p>
                      HTML and CSS is the core foundation of programming, and it can get
                      very fun. I still have more to learn though.

                    <h2>Animation:</h2>
                    <p>
                      I am still fairly new to animation and don't really understand much,
                      but the basics, I am however very motivated to learn more.

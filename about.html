        <p><strong>In the few weeks that I've been here, I've learned to adapt to change. Change of pace in learning, working and even meeting new people. I realised that once I started this coding program, I challenged myself to think outside the box and further and beyond. I haven't much to display because I learn at my own pace (which is slow!) but I can proudly say that the work I have thus far and am able to display makes me happy. Because I did learn something new and something to take pride in.</strong></p>
